Super Sector is a very exciting game on android platform.I like it very much.
But the game always crashed when I got high in my android mobile phone. 
For this reason I decided to implement this game on iOS platform using cocos2d-x.
I have not found a suitable background music for the game.If you have,please contact me.
Thank you!
